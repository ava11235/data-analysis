In statistics we study a set of tools and techniques used for describing, organizing and interpreting data.

**Descriptive statistics** describes the characteristics of a collection of data. For example, describe what is the most popular major for a student population at a college.
**Inferential statistics** provides conclusions (inferences) about populations based on a smaller group (a sample). For example, designing an experiment for a drug trial, including the drug and a placebo,
and extrapolating for the population of patients based on the result of the experiment.

**Measures of Center** summarize information about a dataset and include the mean, the mode and the median.

**Measures of variability** describe the difference between the center of the dataset and the rest of the values. Variance and Standard deviation are measures of variability.
The minimum, maximum, and the range (difference between min and max) also describe the spread of the data.
If you need a refresher on the above concepts, take a look at [this](https://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/201/Fall%202006/Measures-of-Central-Tendency-&-Variability-Overheads.pdf) paper.

**A Box Plot**, also known as Whisker plot, displays the distribution of a dataset and the summary statistics such as minimum, 
first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum.Â  Outliers can also be identified on a box plot.

**A Histogram** is basically used to visualize numerical data distribution.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the material, students will be able to:
* Define descriptive and inferential statistics and survey terminology.
* Recognize different types of statistical biases.
* Define and work with, in Python, measures of center such as mean, mode and median.
* Define and with with, in Python, measures of variability such as variance and standard deviation.
* Build box plots and histograms.
