### Google Colab
"Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs."
Colab is a cloud based option to host your notebooks, and allows for easily storing them in Google drive or exporting them, for example, to GitHub.

### pandas DataFrames
The pandas library is used to work with structured data, such as csv or Excel files. 

The most important object in pandas is the dataframe, Â is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different types 
(including characters, integers, floating point values, categorical data and more) in columns.
It is similar to a spreadsheet, a SQL table or the data.frame in R.

### Example
Let's explore how to work with a pandas dataframe [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xQ4W8QwyFx44neekbtCMOAUfJd4RYvmm?usp=sharing)

### Bar Charts
Bar charts are used to visualize categorical distributions. Some examples of categorical distributions include: survey responses, movie genre or product brands.
The bar chart displays a bar for each category, where each bar is equally spaced and wide. 
The length of the bar is proportional to the frequency of the category visualized.
There are horizontal, vertical, relative, and stacked bars. Python libraries provide the functions to depict all these types of bars.
Note that different types of visualizations are used for numerical frequences. More on this later.
