Data literacy is becoming increasingly important in today's world.

Being able to explore, understand and communicate with data is an important skill.
Today the amount of data collected per year is measured in zettabytes (1o^21). In 2020 the worldwide data collection reached 40 zettabyes from 
sources such as social networks, IOT, and business systems.

Data Analytics is the growing field of gaining insights and making decisions based on data, and more recently, big data (data too big to be processed by traditional methods).
Data analysis is applied to most fields today.

There are three types of data analytics:
* Descriptive. This type focuses on providing insights and knowledge.
* Predictive data analytics seeks to make predictions from data.
* Prescriptive data analytics seeks to prescribe decisions or recommendations based on data.

Data comes in different formats. Some of the more common types of data include csv (comma separated value) files, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), 
and XML (Extensible  Markup Language).

Data Visualization refers to the display of data in ways that effectively convey information.
