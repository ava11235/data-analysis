Types of data in a column can be: 
* Numerical, where each value is from a fixed scale, are ordered,and differences are meaningful.
* Categorical, where each value is from a fixed category, may or may not have an ordering, and the categories can be same or different.
A distribution refers to the frequency of different values of a variable. A distribution can be  measured in counts, proportions or percents.

Categorical distributions can be visualized as bart charts.
Numerical variables can be plotted with scatter plots or line graphs.


A scatter plot displays the relation between two numerical variables. 

A line graph, a very common visualization tool, is often used to represent chronological trends.
